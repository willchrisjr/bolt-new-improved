- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Manually verify all new functionality works as expected
- [ ] Keep PRs focused and atomic

### üëÄ Review Process

2. At least one maintainer review required
3. Address all review comments
4. Maintain clean commit history

## Coding Standards

### üíª General Guidelines
- Follow existing code style
- Comment complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names

## Development Setup

### üîÑ Initial Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/coleam00/bolt.new-any-llm.git
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your LLM API keys (only set the ones you plan to use):
```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=XXX
OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=XXX
...
```
   - Optionally set debug level:
```bash
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug
```
**Important**: Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It's already included in .gitignore.

### üöÄ Running the Development Server
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

**Note**: You will need Google Chrome Canary to run this locally if you use Chrome! It's an easy install and a good browser for web development anyway.

## Adding New LLM Providers and Models

To add new LLM providers and models, follow these steps:

1. **Update `MODEL_LIST` in `app/utils/constants.ts`**:
   - Open the `app/utils/constants.ts` file.
   - Locate the `MODEL_LIST` constant.
   - Add a new entry to the `MODEL_LIST` array with the following structure:
     ```typescript
     {
       name: 'model-id', // The model ID from the provider's API documentation
       label: 'Model Label', // A label for the frontend model dropdown
       provider: 'ProviderName' // The name of the provider
     }
     ```

2. **Implement Provider-Specific Logic**:
   - If the provider is not already implemented, you will need to add provider-specific logic in `app/lib/.server/llm/model.ts`.
   - Create a new function for the provider that encapsulates its specific logic.
   - Ensure the function returns a consistent interface.

3. **Manage API Keys and Base URLs**:
   - Add the provider's API key and base URL to the central configuration in `app/lib/.server/llm/api-key.ts`.
   - Use environment variables to manage these values.

4. **Handle Errors Gracefully**:
   - Implement error handling for the new provider to manage issues like invalid API keys or network errors.

5. **Document the New Provider**:
   - Update the documentation in `app/lib/.server/llm/model.ts` to include the new provider.
   - Add any specific requirements or limitations for the new provider.

6. **Test the Integration**:
   - Manually verify that the new provider and model work as expected.
   - Ensure that the functions return a consistent interface and handle errors gracefully.

7. **Update the `README.md`**:
   - Add information about the new provider and model to the `README.md` file.
   - Include any specific setup instructions or requirements.

By following these steps, you can add new LLM providers and models to Bolt.new, making it even more versatile and powerful.
